9 weight Tamil and Latin type family

Catamaran is a stylish type-family with an polished yet relaxed feel. Its versatility makes it suitable for a range of uses.

The word Catamaran refers to a yacht or other boat with twin hulls in parallel. The etymology of the word is traced to early 17th century Tamil - kaṭṭumaram, which literally means ‘tied wood.’

The Catamaran project is led by Pria Ravichandran, a type designer from India. To contribute, visit github.com/VanillaandCream/Catamaran
